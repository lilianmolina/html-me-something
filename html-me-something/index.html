    <p>
        We met in the Spring of 2010, thanks to our mutual friend, now Best Man, Marcus. 
        The spark was immediate and although we did not begin dating until the following year, we both knew our connection was <em>unique</em>. 
        Despite many years of long distance, our relationship continued to grow and evolve through countless hours spent on the phone and unforgettable adventures experienced together.
        <br>
        <br>
        One of those adventures took place in 2016, when we went on our first ski trip together with Zachary's family. 
        Aside from it being my first experience on the slopes, this trip was also the first time we had to really trust one another in a new environment. 
        Through Zachary's careful help, patience and kindness, we made it home alive... just kidding (it was not that serious), 
        but we solidified our bond and developed a new tradition along the way. 
        Fast forward to 2019, on a ski trip to celebrate my 26th birthday, 
        Zachary took me up 10,460 feet and <strong>popped</strong> the question that to this day has me on <em>cloud 9</em>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now, almost 10 years after our fateful first encounter, we are preparing to begin a new chapter as husband and wife. 
        Planning this celebration has encouraged us to think about all of our family and friends who have shared in our love over the years. 
        We cannot imagine celebrating without each and every one of <strong>YOU!</strong> 
        So we hope to see you in Weston, Florida on March 7, 2020 ready for a night of fun, dancing, love and <em>plenty of Perks!</em>
